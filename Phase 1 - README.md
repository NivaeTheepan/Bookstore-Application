Phase 1 of the Bookstore Application, the group had to come up with the initial
design of the GUI. At this stage in the project development, a use case diagram
was created to show what functions our Bookstore Application would have. In the Phase 1 project folder, you will find the many iterations of the use case diagram with the final diagram being named "useCaseDiagram".
